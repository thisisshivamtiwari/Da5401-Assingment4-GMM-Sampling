# GMM-Based Fraud Detection Assignment
## DA5401 A4: Enhanced Synthetic Sampling for Imbalanced Data

### 🎯 **Project Overview**

This project implements an advanced **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based synthetic sampling** approach for handling extremely imbalanced fraud detection data. The assignment demonstrates sophisticated machine learning techniques including clustering-based undersampling, BIC optimization, and comprehensive cross-validation analysis.

### 📊 **Key Features**

- **GMM-Based Synthetic Oversampling**: Probabilistic generation of realistic minority class samples
- **Clustering-Based Undersampling (CBU)**: Intelligent majority class reduction preserving data structure  
- **BIC Optimization**: Automatic selection of optimal GMM components
- **5-Fold Cross-Validation**: Robust performance evaluation with statistical significance testing
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed code comments and academic-quality analysis

### 🛠 **Enhanced Implementation**

This assignment has been upgraded with:

### 📦 **Dataset**

**⚠️ Important**: The `creditcard.csv` dataset (143.84 MB) is not included in this repository due to GitHub's file size limits.

**To get the dataset:**

1. **Download from Kaggle**: [Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
2. **Alternative**: Download from [UCI ML Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients)
3. **Place the file**: Save as `creditcard.csv` in the project root directory

**Dataset Info:**
- **Size**: 284,807 transactions
- **Features**: 30 (V1-V28 PCA components, Time, Amount)
- **Target**: Class (0=Normal, 1=Fraud)
- **Imbalance**: 577:1 ratio (99.83% normal, 0.17% fraud)

### 🚀 **Getting Started**

#### 1. **Prerequisites**
```bash
# Python 3.8+ required
python --version

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 2. **Setup**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/thisisshivamtiwari/Da5401-Assingment4-GMM-Sampling.git
cd Da5401-Assingment4-GMM-Sampling

# Download and place creditcard.csv (see Dataset section above)
# Verify file is present
ls -la creditcard.csv
```

#### 3. **Run the Analysis**
```bash
# Launch Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook Assignment4_DA5401_final.ipynb

# Or run all cells programmatically
jupyter nbconvert --execute Assignment4_DA5401_final.ipynb
```

### 🔬 **Methodology**

#### **1. Baseline Model**
- Logistic Regression on original imbalanced data
- Performance: Precision 86.6%, Recall 63.7%, F1 73.5%

#### **2. GMM-Based Oversampling**
- BIC optimization selects k=5 components
- Generates realistic synthetic fraud samples
- Achieves perfect class balance (1:1 ratio)

#### **3. Clustering-Based Undersampling**
- K-means clustering of majority class (k=3)
- Proportional sampling preserves data structure
- Reduces majority class by 95% while maintaining diversity

#### **4. Combined Approach (GMM + CBU)**
- Optimal balance between synthetic generation and intelligent undersampling
- Best trade-off between recall and model stability

### 📈 **Results Summary**

| Approach | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | ROC-AUC |
|----------|-----------|---------|----------|---------|
| **Baseline** | 86.6% (±3.7%) | 63.7% (±3.1%) | 73.5% (±3.1%) | 98.0% (±1.0%) |
| **GMM-only** | 98.5% (±0.03%) | 94.3% (±0.06%) | 96.4% (±0.02%) | 98.4% (±0.04%) |
| **GMM+CBU** | 97.9% (±0.7%) | 92.7% (±1.5%) | 95.2% (±0.9%) | 98.1% (±0.5%) |
